You don't spend much time in the programming world without finding out about and, most likely, starting to use, Git. It's a distributed version control and source code management system. Git lets you do a lot of really useful things. You can manage your code so that if you accidentally (or intentionally) really mess something up, you can revert your changes. You can upload and download your code so that if you are collaborating with a large group of people, you can share your code without getting involved with the messy process of sending people code through email. 

The issue that I am dearling with is the second point - I want to be able to upload and back up my own code and documents, but I want to be able to make my repositories private. Since I do not want to pay for a code hosting plan, I cannot use GitHub. BitBucket is another option, but I would prefer to host my own code because then I have complete control over what goes on. I have a web server where I host my site, and I had a VPS on that server, so I figured that I would be able to set up a self-hosted version of GitHub. I began searching, and I quickly stumbled onto two choices: RhodeCode and GitLab. At first, GitLab did not work on the system that I had setup, so I used RhodeCode. At first, however, I had problems with RhodeCode because it did not work correctly with the Git on my VPS on any Linux distro other than Suse. However, I also noticed that RhodeCode's interface, while still adequate, was not enough for what I wanted. So I decided to install GitLab, because I heard a lot about it, and according to the demo page it looked pretty good.
