The Great Gatsby is _the_ American novel, with its stylized depiction of New York in the "Roarin' Twenties". It provides a deep look into the American Dream that exposes some of the deep and dark negatives to the widely lauded "trap" of America. Nick, Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, and Jordan are all seeking the American Dream, but each is doing it in his or her own way. Tom is chasing the dream of materialistic pursuit, going to incredible extremes to secure the most luxurious possible item in every realm of imagination, all in the name of Daisy, who wants both the materialistic and sentimental facets of the American Dream - a man she loves who will treat her like a princess. Gatsby solely desires mutual love from someone who he has incredibly deep feelings for (Daisy, in this case) and only dons his attitude of incredible wealthiness in order to try and make her happy.
