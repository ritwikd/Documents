COMMUNITY
========

There is a difference between East Egg and West Egg and the Valley of Ashes. 

Holden wants to feel a sense of community and he is searching for it during his whole time in NYC. He finds it in the end with Phoebe, and he wants a family to all his own, to save children from his fate. He decides this after he sees the family together outside the church with the boy singing. He does not like the phoniness that he feels that the community is full of. 

When Suyuan dies, the Club makes June take her place when they now get together. The immigrants get together to form a support group for each other when they need to help each other in life. The women in it are like sisters, and they help translate the letters and help June go to china to go meet the twin sisters that she never got to meet. 

AMERICAN DREAM
==============

Nick is told that he has been more privileged than others in geting started with the American Dream, because some others, like Gatsby, have had to start from the bottom to get where they want to in life. Nick lived in the less fashionable part of Ney York, but most people wanted to live in the other side because they felt that the fashionability of where they lived was quite important. 

The Joy-Luck Club relates to the American Dream because in the book, all of the characters who were born in China have come to the United States in order to provide new opportunities to themselves and their children. All of the children who have grown up in the country have been able to make their living by doing what they want to in life. This relates to the American dream because it shows that America is the quintessential land where everyone wants to come and live. The children born in America try to balance being both Chinese and American in America, and some succeed more than others.
