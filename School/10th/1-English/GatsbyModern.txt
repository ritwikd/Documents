Our society today is quite similar to the one that existed during the time of Fitzgerald. The pace of life is quite fast - in fact, the world moves at a breakneck pace, especially the world of technology. People are reckless, and often live lives of hedonism and pure fun. Traditional values have been eschewed far further than at any other time in history (except, of course, the time before they were intvented and ground into the minds of society). People are daring to do things that they have never dared to do before because they have nothing to lose - in a world of ubiquitos public opennes, where privacy is a long gone remnant of the "olden days", there is no point in the excercise of futility that is trying to privatize one's life. The 20's may have been quite accurate in forshadowing the modern day - fast, public, and completely radical.
