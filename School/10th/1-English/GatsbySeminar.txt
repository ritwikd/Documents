1. Fitzgerald's ultimate commentary is that the American Dream is ultimately a hollow ideal because it will not pan out the way that it is intended to. Most of the people who try and achieve it are the noveau riche - the classless and young who ultimately are looking for shallow and fake love.

2. Fitzgerald's work is a commentary on the shallow experience that is a relationship based on mutual desire for material wealth - the couple Daisy and Tom, who are not really "married" in the conventional sense, are solely together for the monetary benefits - a civil partnership would mean more and violate less of the sanctity of the instituion that is revered for being so meaningful.

3. Fitzgerald's opinion on the American dream is that it is not really something worth targeting because it is ultimately a shallow and pathetic way to live life - a conformist and materialistic lifestyle that does not work.

4. The Great Gatsby is not the "American" novel because it is no longer completely relevant - much of the content that defines the style of the book is no longer common or used.

5. Gatsby is not a hero - he never does anything particularly beneficial to someone else; all of his work is primarily targeted toward himself; this does not make him a bad person, but nevertheless, definitely not a hero.
