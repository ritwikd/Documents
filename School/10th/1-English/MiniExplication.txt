The poem I chose to explicate is "Fire and Ice", written by Robert Frost. The poem has a theme of sadness and nostalgia, because the author talks of destruction as if he himself has experienced it. He talks of how there are dueling forces in this world and one seems better than the other, but really both are just as bad, when he mentions that although "some say the world will end in fire", and "some say in ice", he feels that "for destruction, ice is also great" (Frost, 5, 6, 7-8). Frost is trying to say that whenever the world will end, it is possible for it to end twice - once with fire and once with ice, because despite the trope of fire being destructive, ice is just as potentially harmful, and the reader should be careful of settling in with either camp because both could hurt just as much.
