The Dove commercial that we watched in class did not really reveal anything new for me. Throughout history, popular people (and more recently, mass media) have always forced the common masses to change their image to fit in. Many people have to overwork themselves in one direction or another in order to try and become "good" or "whole" even though they are, ironically, in fact becoming far worse as they lose the sense of balance in their life. Superficial beauty is not a good thing because it makes people into shallow shells of human beings who no longer are complete people - a single attribute of self loathing makes them into the self-destructive sort of people that they are. The end result is that something malevolent begins to take control of the people who are affected by this sort of disorder, and others are also affected by the spreading web of mental disease. Other trends, like the desire to "fit in" are a similar social cancer - they often force people to make stupid and bad decision solely so that they will fit into the world, even though in the end it does not matter if you fit in or not if you are not doing the right thing and being yourself.
