Martin Luther King is very clearly alluding to the Kingdom of God in his speech. Many of the statements he makes are almost blatantly aping the words of the Bible. King was a preacher, so he drew much of his inspiration from the "word of God", and wove these beliefs and ideologies into his famous speech. One example is when he mentions, "stepping off the dark [valley] of segregation [into] the bright sunlit path [of equality]". When King wrote this, he was clearly talking about how Jesus encouraged the people to walk off of the path of sin into the path of Good that would guide them to the Kingdom of God. King also mentions much about how he hopes for the Lord to deliver the people from the segregation that they face - which is very similar to a passage in the Bible in which Jesus says the same thing. Both people want to be taken from their current lives, which are not very good or comfortable, to living in paradise in the Kingdom of God. Another last thing that King mentioned when he talked was about brotherhood among people of all the different races - this is very clearly a reference to the brotherhood Jesus mentioned when he talked of the traits that would lead to people being inducted into the Kingdom of God. Jesus ad King both intended for at their "disciples" (a bit of a stretch in King's context, but passable) to take heart and faith in their words so that they could survive the dificult time and hopefully return to salvation afterwards.
