My favorite teacher is probably my 6th grade math teacher, Mr. Guansing. He is my favorite teacher for a multitude of reasons. He was probably the first teacher I ever had who really understood me. At first, in class I would not always be able to do well on tests because of careless mistakes, and he explained to me how it was worth the extra 10 minutes of free time to try and make sure my test scores were better instead of finishing early and using the free time to work on something else. When I finished the work that the class was currently doing, he always let me read the textbook for the next level course in math so that I would not be bored and waste my time. When I did something wrong, he would explain to me why what I did was wrong and how I could fix it and avoid doing so in the future. When I solved a difficult problem, he would always make sure to commend me so I felt that my effort was appreciated. A good teacher is one who is always fair to the students because justice is one of the most important virtues of human character. The good teacher also takes the time and effort to make the subject interesting to the students, and takes interest in the lives of the students. Mr. Guansing had all of these qualities, and also clearly embodied the most important qualities of Jesus' teaching because he showed love and appreciation in all of his teachings.

The teacher you talk about in your post seems to embody quite well the qualities that Jesus used in his teaching. Mrs. Lawler seems to be an interesting person who was gifted at conveying ideas to students, even if they did not want to learn the material, by enthralling them in it and making them eager to learn more. The most important quality, however, that your teacher embodies in the spirit of Jesus, is love.
